# Zebra Puzzles
*Today, in 2023, project is largely unmaintained. I'm using it as a playground for some things I want to try out, but I don't recommend anyone build off this.*

Remember logic puzzles like this? With clues like:
 * *There is one house between Tushar and Maui.*
 * *Ruby's favorite video game is Pokemon.*
 * *The chai drinker does not like the color blue.*

I loved these as a kid, and watching Raymond Hettinger's [PyCon 2019 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GP9OpZPUYc) inspired me to revisit these problems. He showed us how to solve themâ€”I wanted to learn how to generate them.

Using modern Python and constraint satisfaction (SAT) solvers, this project can be used to create random zebra puzzles.

## Structure
This project has five Python files:
 * `sat_utils.py` is basic utilities for interacting with the SAT solver [pycosat](https://pypi.org/project/pycosat/); this code was almost entirely written by [Raymond Hettinger](https://rhettinger.github.io/einstein.html#essential-utilities-for-humanization)
 * `puzzle.py` contains the main `Puzzle` class and two sample puzzles that can be solved
 * `literals.py` contains the different puzzle elements via a base `Literal` and subclasses (people, favorite types of tea, most-played video games, etc.)
 * `clues.py` contains the different classes of clues via a base `Clue` and subclasses ("x is at the same house as y", "x is somewhere to the left of z", etc.)
 * `generate.py` is the **main entry point** into this project, creating new puzzles.

The project uses Python 3.8 (required!) and [pycosat](https://pypi.org/project/pycosat/). I manage dependencies with Poetry, but do whatever you want. I made heavy use of type hinting through the *excellent* [Pylance](github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/) VS Code extension that Microsoft [just released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-pylance-fast-feature-rich-language-support-for-python-in-visual-studio-code/).

*n.b.: this is funny to read 3 years after Pylance was released. It's great to see how far the typing ecosystem has come since then.*

## Future work
There are a few things I still want to do:
 * configure random solution generation
 * try out creating a smaller size (e.g., 4 houses) with more categories; that sounds like a fun puzzle!
 * create a better CLI

These may happen. But the project is finally at a place that I'm happy with, and so I'm excited to share and write about it.
