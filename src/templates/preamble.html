Traptop has been busy! A bunch of Traptors came to her nests recently, and she needs help figuring out which Traptor went where. She left some clues for us. Can you help her out? <br><br>

<i>Editor's note</i>: I'm playing around with reusing puzzle elements. This is easier than having to create a brand new puzzle every week. Please be sure to read the clues closely, and enjoy! <br><br>
