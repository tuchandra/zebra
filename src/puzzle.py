    A Puzzle is defined as a collection of constraints and clues.

    Clues are subclassess of Clue. They represent information about the puzzle that can be used by
    a human to solve it, like "the man who drinks tea owns a cat." Clues aren't converted to CNF
    until the `as_cnf` method is called.

    Constraints are structural properties of the puzzle, given to us in CNF to start. They're
    things like "each house gets exactly one type of flower" and "each flower must be assigned
    to one house." These will be the same for every Puzzle, so we have a default `set_constraints`
    method that takes care of them.

    We can add clues with `add_clue`. This returns the instance, so they can be chained together.

    Since in constraint satisfaction land, clues and constraints are the same thing (they're just
    logical clauses), we lump them all together at solve time.

Quag's version

In honor of Mother's Day, a feast is being held to celebrate five Moms: Aniya, Holly,
Janelle, Kailyn, and Penny. Each Mom will be served by their son or daughter (Bella,
Fred, Meredith, Samantha, and Timothy), who will also place a bouquet of flowers
(Carnations, Daffodils, Lilies, Roses, or Tulips) at their Mom's place setting and
prepare a meal for them (Grilled Cheese, Pizza, Spaghetti, Stew, or Stir Fry).

The seats are arranged in a straight line at the head table, with the first being
the furthest to the left (from our perspective, not the Mom's perspectives).

Also, when it says there is "one chair" between two people, it means one person might
be in the second chair while the other person is in the fourth (i.e. there is one chair
in between them that neither is sitting in).
