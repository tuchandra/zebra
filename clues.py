clues.py

These are all the clue types that a puzzle can have. Things like "the tea drinker lives in the
green house" and "the cat owner lives left of the person who likes grilled cheese."

There's a Clue ABC that requires you implement an `as_cnf` method, to convert the clue to an
and-of-ors (probably using things defined in `sat_utils`), and a human-readable __repr__ that
can be used in a puzzle description.
